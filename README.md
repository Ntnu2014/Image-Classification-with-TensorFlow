# Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow

Image classification is a common task for deep learning and neural networks. 
The raw features coming in are the pixel values. 
These are simple enough to deal with, but it is difficult to connect pixel values to determining whether an image is of a cat. Older methods used a lot of clever filters, but the current best-of-breed algorithms simply throw a lot of linear algebra at the problem.

In this miniproject, series of models are built to classify a series of images.
Smallest delta model
Softmax model
Fully-connected model
